            Harry James[58] Potter (b. 31 July 1980)[1] was an English
            half-blood[2] wizard, and one of the most famous wizards of modern
            times. The only child and son of James and Lily Potter (née Evans),
            Harry's birth was overshadowed by a prophecy, naming either himself
            or Neville Longbottom as the one with the power to vanquish Lord
            Voldemort, the most powerful and feared Dark Wizard in the world.
            After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, courtesy of
            Severus Snape, Harry was chosen as the target due to his many
            similarities with the Dark Lord. In turn, this caused the Potter
            family to go into hiding.
